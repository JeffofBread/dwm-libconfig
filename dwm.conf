# Example/default dwm-libconfig configuration file.
# It is intended to be a near 1:1 replica of the default dwm-6.6 `config.(def.).h`.
#
# For more information, please go to https://github.com/JeffofBread/dwm-libconfig/
#

#
# Warnings:
#       This is named "themes", but that is slightly deceptive. dwm
#       only has the ability to use a single theme by default, so
#       the parser is set to only use the first theme in the list.
#
# The themes are structured as such:
#       1) "font": A string containing an XLFD or FreeType font. See:
#               -  https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/X_Logical_Font_Description
#               -  https://dwm.suckless.org/customisation/font/
#
#       2) "normal-foreground", "normal-background", "normal-border",
#          "selected-foreground", "selected-background", "selected-border":
#          These all should be strings containing hex color codes, including
#          the pound/hash symbol (#).
#
themes = (
        {
                font = "monospace:size=10";

                normal-foreground = "#bbbbbb";
                normal-background = "#222222";
                normal-border = "#444444";

                selected-foreground = "#eeeeee";
                selected-background = "#005577";
                selected-border = "#005577";
        }
);

#
# Notes:
#       I recommend reading suckless' explanation of the `rules` array.
#       It generally still applies here, just in a config file instead
#       of source code.
#               - https://dwm.suckless.org/customisation/rules/
#               - https://dwm.suckless.org/customisation/tagmask/
#
# The rules are structured as such:
#       1) "class": String containing the SECOND element of WM_CLASS of
#           the desired client to be effected by this rule.
#
#       2) "instance": String containing the FIRST element of WM_CLASS of
#           the desired client to be effected by this rule.
#
#       3) "title": String containing _NET_WM_NAME or WM_NAME of
#           the desired client to be effected by this rule.
#
#       4) "tag-mask": Tag bitmask to move the client to. For example, a
#          bitmask of '4' (2^3) would move the client to tag 3.
#
#       5) "floating": Floating state of the client. 1 is floating, 0 is tiled.
#
#       6) "monitor": Monitor to move the client to. -1 moves the client to
#          the currently focused monitor.
#
rules = (
        {
                class = "Gimp";
                instance = "NULL";
                title = "NULL";
                tag-mask = 0;
                floating = 1;
                monitor = -1;
        },
        {
               class = "Firefox";
               instance = "NULL";
               title = "NULL";
               tag-mask = 256; # Same as `1 << 8` in C
               floating = 1;
               monitor = -1;
        }
);

#
# Warnings:
#       1) Make sure the line is appended with a comma,
#          because without it libconfig will think it is
#          a single multi-line keybind
#
#       2) The keysym part of the keybind (ex. Q, A, Return)
#          can be case sensitive. Basic alphabetical characters
#          should not be an issue, but things like `Grave` or
#          `Return` MUST be capitalized to work. Others, like
#          `Scroll_Lock` are both capitalized and seperated by
#          an underscore. I recommend using xev to check how
#          a bind is spelled.
#
# The keybinds are structured as follows
#       1) Modifier(s). This is an optional part of the bind that defines
#          another special key that must be pressed with your main key.
#          Modifier(s) must be seperated by '+' from the main key and other
#          modifiers. A list of all modifiers is below. You can use a max
#          of 3 modifiers.
#
#       2) Main key. This is a required part of the bind, and defines the
#          main key required to invoke the defined function. The main key
#          must be seperated from any modifiers with a '+', and seperated
#          from the function with a comma. It is recommended to use a
#          program like `xev` to find the name of the key. Note,
#          capitalization is important in many cases, though dwm will try
#          and correct for SOME of this (like with A-Z characters).
#
#       3) Function. This is the function that will be invoked when the key
#          combination is pressed. It also determines the type of argument
#          (if any) is required in the third (and final) section of the keybind.
#          It should be seperated from the previous section (modifiers + key)
#          with a comma. A list of all available functions and their argument
#          types is listed below. Note, if no argument is required, then there
#          is no need for a comma after your function (inside the quotes, a
#          comma is still required at the end of line).
#
#       4) Argument. This is the information that will be passed to the
#          function in the third field (if an argument is required by that
#          function). Make sure these values are of the correct type listed
#          by your chosen function, else the bind could be invalidated when
#          dwm attempts to parse it, or it could lead to logical errors.
#

#               "Main Key, Function, Argument"

# Buttonbinds follow a very similar structure to the above keybinds.
# Read how the keybinds work before reading the below, it is necessary context.
#
# Buttonbinds only differ in 2 ways.
#       1) The Main Key has been replaced by a Button instead
#       2) An extra element (second, directly after Modifiers + Button)
#          has been added, and defines what on screen the cursor needs
#          to be hovering over to use the bind.
#
# Example formats:
#       "Button, Clickable, Function, Argument"
#       "Modifier + Button, Clickable, Function, Argument"
#       "Modifier + Modifier + Button, Clickable, Function, Argument"
#       "Modifier + Modifier + Modifier + Button, Clickable, Function, Argument"
#       "Modifier + Button, Clickable, Function (doesn't require argument)"
#       "Button, Clickable, Function (doesn't require argument)"
#
# Available Buttons:
#       "leftclick" or "left-click",
#       "middleclick" or "middle-click",
#       "rightclick" or "right-click",
#       "scrollup" or "scroll-up",
#       "scrolldown" or "scroll-down",
#
#       Or any integer 1-255. Use xev to see what you need.
#
# Available Clickable Elements:
#       "tag",
